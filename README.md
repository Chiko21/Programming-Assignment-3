# Programming-Assignment-3

# MACHINE LEARNING
Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables software programs to improve their accuracy at predicting outcomes without being explicitly designed to do so. Machine learning algorithms estimate new output values by using past data as input.

# PURPOSE
The purpose of this assignment is to model or training the give dataset using one of these learning method which are Decision Tree (ID3), KNN or Na√Øve Bayes. For our group, we have chose KNN as our method in this programming assignment.

# HOW TO RUN THE PROJECT
We have used KNN method for this program in order to train and test the dataset given. First and foremost, we calculate the distance between 2 points using Manhattan distance formula. Next, we do the Normalization which we recalculate the data to the values between 0 and 1. Then, we split the Data into a Training Set and Test Set. Lastlt, we do the validation as we can choose the best K and Fold which is suitable to use for testing the dataset.
